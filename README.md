A compact implementation of the notch root approximations according to Neuber and Seeger and Beste.

#### About
This repository contains an Implementation to iterativelivy solve notch root approximations coupled with the Ramberg and Osgood material law. This specific Implementation focuses on two notch root approximations used within the German Guildeline "Rechnerischer Festigkeitsnachweis für Maschinenbauteile unter expliziter Berücksichtigung Nichtlinearen Materialverhaltens” (Analytical strength assessment for components under explicit consideration of nonlinear material behaviour. This guideline proposes the use of an extended version of Neuber's rule and the method according to Seeger and Beste.
